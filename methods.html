<h3> <p style="color:white"> In the last period, scientists tried to reach a treatment that eliminates this disease, but they could not,
 but they came up with medicines that reduce the symptoms of the disease and may eliminate it at some times.
What types of drugs might work?
There are three broad approaches being investigated:
Antiviral drugs that directly affect the coronavirus's ability to thrive inside the body
Drugs that can calm the immune system - patients become seriously ill when their immune system overreacts and starts causing collateral damage to the body
Antibodies, either from survivors' blood or made in a lab, that can attack the virus
